Technologies Used:

HTML:
Each section (About, Projects, Contact) has an id and the class hidden by default, except for the first section (About).
Buttons in the navigation menu have a data-section attribute that corresponds to the id of the respective section.

CSS:
The .hidden class hides the sections, and the .active class makes them visible.

JavaScript:
When a button is clicked, the script hides all sections by adding the hidden class and removing active.
It then shows the clicked section by removing hidden and adding active.
